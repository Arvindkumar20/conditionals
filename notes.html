    Comparison Operators:

    Equal (==):
    Compares two values for equality, ignoring type.
    Strict Equal (===):
    Compares two values for equality, considering type.
    Not Equal (!=):
    Compares two values for inequality, ignoring type.
    Strict Not Equal (!==):
    Compare two values for inequality, considering type.
    Greater Than (>):
    Check if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
    Less Than (<):
    Check if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
    Greater Than or Equal (>=):
    Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
    Less Than or Equal (<=):
    Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
    
            Example :
                console.log(10 == "10"); // true
    console.log(10 === "10"); // false
    console.log(10 != "10"); // false
    console.log(10 !== "10"); // true
    console.log(10 > 5); // true
    console.log(10 < 5); // false
    console.log(10 >= 10); // true
    console.log(10 <= 5); // false
    Logical Operators :
    
    AND (&&):
    Returns true if both operands are true.
    OR (||):
    Returns true if at least one operand is true.
    NOT (!):
    Inverts the Boolean value of the operand.
    
            Example : 
                    console.log(true && false); // false
    console.log(true || false); // true
    console.log(!true); // false
    
    
    Assignment Operators
        
    Assignment (=):
    Assigns a value to a variable.
    Add and Assign (+=):
    Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to that variable.
    Subtract and Assign (-=):
    Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to that variable.
    Multiply and Assign (*=):
    Multiplies a value with a variable and assigns the result to that variable.
    Divide and Assign (/=):
    Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
    Modulus and Assign (%=):
    Computes the modulus of a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
    
            Example : 
                let c = 10;
    c += 5; // c = c + 5; c = 15
    c -= 2; // c = c - 2; c = 13
    c *= 2; // c = c * 2; c = 26
    c /= 2; // c = c / 2; c = 13
    c %= 3; // c = c % 3; c = 1
    Control Statements
    Programming Constructs: They dictate the flow of execution based on conditions or loops.
    Decision-Making: Includes conditional statements (if, if-else, else if, switch) to execute code based on specific conditions.
    Repetitive Execution: Utilizes looping statements (for, while, do-while) to repeat blocks of code until a condition is met.
    Handling Flow: Control statements manage the sequence of operations within a program, enabling dynamic responses to different scenarios.
    Enhancing Logic: Essential for structuring logic, iterating through data, and handling errors in JavaScript applications.
    
    
    if Statement:
    Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
    
    Syntax:
        if (condition) {
        // Code to be executed if condition is true
    }
    
    Example:
    let hour = 15;
    if (hour < 18) {
        greeting = "Good day";
    }
    
    
    if-else Statement:
    Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
    
    Syntax :
            if (condition) { 
    // Code to be executed if condition is true 
    } else { 
    // Code to be executed if condition is false 
    }
    
        Example : 
            let hour = 22;
    if (hour < 18) {
        greeting = "Good day";
    } else {
        greeting = "Good evening";
    }
    
    else if Statement:
    Specifies a new condition to test if the first condition is false.
    
    Syntax:
        if (condition1) { 
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) { 
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true 
    } else {
    // Code to be executed if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true 
    }
    
    
            Example : 
                let hour = 10;
    if (hour < 12) {
        greeting = "Good morning";
    } else if (hour < 18) {
        greeting = "Good afternoon";
    } else {
        greeting = "Good evening";
    }
    
    Switch Statement:
    Evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.
    
    Syntax : 
        switch (expression) {
        case value1:
            // Code to be executed if expression === value1
            break;
        case value2:
            // Code to be executed if expression === value2
            break;
        default:
            // Code to be executed if expression does not match any case
    }
    
    Example : 
        let day = 2;
    switch (day) {
        case 1:
            text = "Monday";
            break;
        case 2:
            text = "Tuesday";
            break;
        default:
            text = "Another day";
    }
